# The "this" Binding

`this` is a binding to the call-site of an executing function. The value of `this` is determined by how a function was invoked, and has nothing to do with a function's lexical scope.

The value of `this` will be one of four possible function invocation types, in order of precedence:
1. **new Binding**: A function was called with the `new` operator
2. **Explicit bindings**:
3. **Implicity binding**:
4. **Default binding**:
